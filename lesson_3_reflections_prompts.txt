When working with multiple people on a bigger project, It is better to have the code staged onto github

Rather than a continuous sync it is better to have pull changes as and when needed. The reason being it is much less prone to errors and you can pull merge onlywhen you are ready

fork is githubs clone. git clone is more general purpose copying of a repo. branching is to take a different path of development on the same repo.

Having the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote store locally helps delay a tedious merge process in case on conflicts. Plus it gives you the idea surrounding what level of conflicts would exist
